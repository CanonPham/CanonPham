My name is Canon Pham, and I am an undergraduate student at Stanford University passionate about using data analytics and machine learning to investigate real-world social issues. I am intending to major in Data Science and Social Systems on the Technology and Society track and hope to gain more practical and research experience in this field over the course of my undergraduate career. Currently, I am proficient in Python, building machine learning models, and PostgreSQL, though I am also working toward gaining proficiency in AWS and R. Outside of data science, I enjoy working with the Haas Center for Public Service to make service active on campus, practicing/performing with hip hop dance group Common Origins, and spending time with family and friends.
